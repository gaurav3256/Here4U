                <p>
                    Here4U is a team of young individuals dedicated to serving society in the best possible way. We started our journey with the idea of raising awareness among people, especially the youth. We have always wanted to see a change in our society, and with this thought in mind, we decided to become the change we wanted to see.
                </p>
                <h2>Journey So Far</h2>
                <p>
                    Our journey has been a rollercoaster ride with some brilliant highs and lows. We have successfully set up our Weekly Pathshala for kids in need. Additionally, we have been conducting sessions on Good Touch and Bad Touch in elementary schools, aiming to safeguard as many children as possible from social evils. With the increasing cases of road rash and road accidents, we launched a Road Safety program throughout the city to raise awareness. We have successfully covered a few prime spots in Jaipur and plan to cover more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the world a better place for everyone, we have also tried to help our furry friends by installing automated feeders and providing warm mattresses during harsh winters. We wish to undertake as many initiatives as possible to serve our society in the best possible manner.

                    We aim to bring every living being to an equal level so that we can willfully choose to live harmoniously in society. We strongly believe that bringing out the humane side of people is the key to a happier living space. Our focus is to provide a platform for people to raise questions about social evils and to fight against them. We believe in sharing, which is why we are ready to lend a helping hand wherever and whenever it is required. Our goal is not just to serve society but to make it a better place for all living beings.

Our collective goal is to bring a smile to every face we come across, and to make this possible, we are working hard to provide for those in need.
